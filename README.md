Final Year Project
We have fol things to do:
1. Feature Detection
2. Keypoints Matching
3. Initial Triangulation
4. point cloud generation
 The only thing we have done so far is Feature detection and keypoints matching.
 I tried the match_loop_2.py code with 29 images, which took 2 mins and 21 secs to complete. 
 -IFHAM
 
 If you are running code on your pc, make sure you have given correct path of the images.
 Try running rename.py on the dataset of images to rename the files in numbers.
 When running match_loop_2.py:
 check the loop parameters first, make changes to the code according to the number of images bring uploaded to the script. 
  
-Happy Coding :)
