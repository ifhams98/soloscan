Final Year Project
We have fol things to do:
1. Feature Detection
2. Keypoints Matching
3. Initial Triangulation
4. point cloud generation
 The only thing we have done so far is Feature detection and keypoints matching.
 I tried the match_loop_2.py code with 29 images, which took 2 mins and 21 secs to complete.
